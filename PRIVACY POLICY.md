# DATA COLLECTION #

This app collects and stores some data from users:

* Group ID - this is generated by the app, and a list of all group ids ever generated is stored in an online database to prevent duplication. There is no way to turn this off, but ids contain no identifying information unless customised by the user.

* Game Data - this app stores the following data from each game in an online database, which can be enabled or disabled by the user. Database entry names are generated based on the data, but are semi anonymised.
	* Game Data (Selected Characters, Eternals, Number of Players, Souls and who won)
	* Game ID (which contains group id and time of game)
	* Group ID
	* Player Name (as input by the user - can simply be a screen name)

# ACCESS REQUIREMENTS #

The app can access your wifi state (for the purposes of uploading data only on wifi) and files locally on your device as a user input. Neither of these require specific permission from the android OS and are within the bounds of a normal app.
