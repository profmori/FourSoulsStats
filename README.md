# FourSoulsStats

An app to allow the storage of results for The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls.

Final aim is to get widespread data collection on the strongest and weakest characters, as well as allowing individual playgroups to track their own statistics. This used to be a spreadsheet just for my playgroup on a google sheet but since there are so many characters I thought I'd bite the bullet and make a proper solution.

Advice always welcomed. Code is probably terrible as I have never done Kotlin before, or handled databases.
